               Manhattan is one of the five boroughs of New York City, located on the island of
               the same name. The history of Manhattan dates back thousands of years, when the
               area was inhabited by Indians. In 1524, Florentine explorer
               <span class="bold color3">Giovanni da Verrazzano</span>
               , sailing in service of King Francis I of France, became the first documented
               European to visit the area that would become New York City.
               <br/><br/>
               In the 19th century, Manhattan became one of the most important
               <span class="bold color4">economic centers</span>
               in the United States, and its dense development and tall buildings, including the
               first willows, became a symbol of the power of the city and the country. In the
               1990s and 2000s, Manhattan experienced rapid growth in the financial services
               sector, becoming a center of commerce and business around the world.
